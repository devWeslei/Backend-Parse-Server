# Backend-Parse-Server   
 
## Backend using      
-Parse Server.   
-Back4App.     
-Insomnia.    
-PIX functionality: AWS.amazon, EF√≠-Gerencianet.   

## Structure      
![structure](https://github.com/devWeslei/Backend-Parse-Server/blob/main/cloud/assets/1.png)


## Functionalities 
-SignUp.   
-login.   
-PIX payments.   
-complete structure of a virtual store like add item, remove item, modify quantity item.   
-pay cart items.   
-refund request functionality.      
 ***hey! look out: this app's interface is being developed with Flutter.***   

## Difficulties      
-many configurations on platforms with endpoints, certificates, to link the PIX payment with the backend structure of the app.
so I needed to read the documents, see the examples, everything slowly and very carefully.
